This confirms the accuracy of the preconditions of f2_out (called from f1) and of the postconditions of f1.

Recursion
(1) This test checks the mutualy recursive "f2_out" and "f2-in" functions by enforcing "f2_out" and replacing the internal "f2_in" call with its contract.
(2) this test does not require unwinding
(3) The base case for the recursive call to f2 provides the same behavior as the common case (given the pre-conditions)
