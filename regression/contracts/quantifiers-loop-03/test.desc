Verification:
This test case checks the handling of a forall expression within
a loop invariant.
In this test, the quantified variable has a symbolic upper limit.
Additionally, the number of loop iterations is also defined by a
symbolic value.

Known Bug:
Currently, cbmc (using the SAT back-end) does not support quantified
expressions where the quantified variable has a symbolic range.
