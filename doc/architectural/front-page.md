CProver Documentation
=====================

These pages contain both user tutorials and automatically-generated API
documentation. Users can download CProver tools from the
<a href="http://www.cprover.org/">CProver website</a>; contributors
should use the <a href="https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc">repository</a>
hosted on GitHub.

### For users:

* The \ref cprover-manual "CProver Manual" details the capabilities of
  CBMC and SATABS and describes how to install and use these tools. It
  also covers the underlying theory and prerequisite concepts behind how
  these tools work.

### For contributors:

* If you already know exactly what you're looking for, the API reference
  is generated from the codebase. You can search for classes and class
  members in the search bar at top-right or use one of the links in the
  sidebar.
